Learning Git

1. Make the change locally. Save.
2. Get the status of local branch `git status`
3. Identify which file to commit `git add <file name>` 
4. add a description `git commit -m "description"`
5. push the commit to the remote (github) `git push`

The change will now be in your history on Github
